" @PCornibe : @realDonaldTrump You are a genuine compassionate man . Loved the show last night ." Thanks Peggy . 
. @BarbaraJWalters made a great decision in firing @JoyVBehar from @theviewtv . The show will be better without her ! 
The lobbyists amp ; special interests have just put out an ad for Jeb which hits me " just a little " but is very false ! 
" @WealthyJACK @realDonaldTrump True . I read it - great book , Mr . Trump ." Thanks . 
" @Scalplock : @realDonaldTrump says it . Stop sending money to Mexico until Marine freed . #tcot #PJNET "
