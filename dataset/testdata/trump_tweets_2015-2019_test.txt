I just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the Media is . Truth doesnt matter to them , they only have their hatred agenda . This includes fake books , which come out about me all the time , always anonymous sources , and are pure fiction . Enemy of the People ! 
I kept hearing that there would be massive rallies against me in the UK , but it was quite the opposite . The big crowds , which the Corrupt Media hates to show , were those that gathered in support of the USA and me . They were big enthusiastic as opposed to the organized flops ! 
I cannot believe the level of dishonesty in the media . It is totally out of control , but we are winning !
