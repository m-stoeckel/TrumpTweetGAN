Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time . Highly restrictive on Trade ! They must open their markets and take down their trade barriers ! They report a really high surplus on trade with us . Do Timber amp ; Lumber in U . S .? 
Tariffs will make our Country MUCH STRONGER , not weaker . Just sit back and watch ! In the meantime , China should not renegotiate deals with the U . S . at the last minute . This is not the Obama Administration , or the Administration of Sleepy Joe , who let China get away with murder !

The large and violent French protests dont take into account how badly the United States has been treated on Trade by the European Union or on fair and reasonable payments for our GREAT military protection . Both of these topics must be remedied soon . 
The United States must , at long last , be treated fairly on Trade . If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods , and they charge us 25 , 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours , it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated . That is not Free or Fair Trade , it is Stupid Trade !
