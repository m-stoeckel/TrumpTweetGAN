China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates , as always , in order to make up for the business they are , and will be , losing . If the Federal Reserve ever did a match , it would be game over , we win ! In any event , China wants a deal ! 
The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement . Do NOT attack Syria , fix U . S . A .
